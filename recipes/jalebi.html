    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delightful Indian dessert, jalebi is made by deep-frying a fermented batter into spiral shapes and then soaking them in saffron-infused sugar syrup. The result is a crispy, juicy, and syrupy treat with a perfect balance of sweetness and tang. Served hot, jalebi is enjoyed at festivals, special occasions, or simply as an indulgent snack with milk or rabri.</p>
